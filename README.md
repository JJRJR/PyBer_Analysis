## Overview of the analysis
    V. Isualize wants us to create a new dataframe showing the differences between total weekly fares by city type. In order to accomplish this we needed to combine the two data sets into one dataframe. Once we were able to get the data together we created a summary depicting the total rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Then we created a pivot table and used the resample function to create a multiple line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. The line graph cleanly illustrates how each city type performed by week. 

## Results
    - Rural rides and drivers are signicantly lower than the suburban and urban city types. 
    - Total fares matched the same deparity as the amount of rides and drivers per city type.
    - The average fare per ride was pretty close with with the top end only being approximately $10 away from the bottom. 
    - The average fare per driver has a pretty big gap from the high end to the low end at approximately $30.
